Filters convert and manipulate data for eventual output.

>  {% assign value = "Testing" %}
>  {{ value | upcase }}

<  TESTING

Filters can also themselves take parameters.

>  {{ value | replace: "ing", with: "ers" }}

<  Testers

Filters can be chained together, run as many as you want!

>  {{ value | replace: "ing", with: "ers" | upcase }}

<  TESTERS
